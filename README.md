Duke Leto I Atreides
====================

You probably don't care about this repo.

You certainly probably wont fork it or anything.

Best to turn away now.

## What is this?

These are the scripts and utilities for the containers running on my "Leto"
server on my private, home network. I'm putting them up on github (public)
because **a)** there's nothing secure in here and **b)** there's stuff in
here that may be of use to people. Who knows?

## What do you need to run it?

I'm running these things on a [openSUSE MicroOS](https://microos.opensuse.org/)
server running:

* [Buildah](https://buildah.io/) (image creation)
* [podman](https://podman.io/) (container management)
