WebSSH2
=======

This container is my webssh2 instance. Basically, I'd like to be able to SSH
around my network even if I'm on a system that doesn't have a native SSH
client or terminal (or ones that I dislike using). I'd use this on my
gaming PC, or my wife's *shudder* Mac.

It uses [webssh2](https://github.com/billchurch/webssh2).

Here's a [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j6LlttPcWY) that
shows how the deployment and usage works.
