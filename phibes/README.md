Phibes
======

This container is for the password storage in my system. It uses
[Phibes](https://github.com/GlenRSmith/Phibes) for secrets management.

All of the scripts here are for the creation and management of the docker
container. The actual setting of the secrets *will not* be stored in this
repo (because, **duh** I'm not putting my passwords in github foo!)
